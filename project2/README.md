# FYS4411 Project 2:
## The restricted Boltzmann machine applied to the quantum many-body problem

Compile by running `./compile_project`, creates the executable `./rbm`.

The current configuration of `main.cpp` is set up to run a simple case, but the number of iterations can be modified by changing the parameters in the `main()` function.  Specifically, the number of cycles can be changed by modifying `nCyclesPow2` and `nCyclesSigma`.
