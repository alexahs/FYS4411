# How-to

The order of running is as follows:

1. processing.py -> outputs to `/DataProcessed/`
2. plots.py -> outputs to `/Plots/`

In order to run `plots.py`, you must modify the dict `iters` at `line 386` to reflect the number of cycles performed in each step of the file `main.cpp`.  These can also be found in the completed files in `/Data/`.
